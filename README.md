# StudentPerformancePrediction
The StudentPerformancePrediction repository offers a machine learning framework designed to forecast student academic performance. It integrates data preprocessing, SMOTE for handling class imbalances, feature selection, and model optimization techniques like Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) to enhance prediction accuracy.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the dataset for analysis.
SMOTE: Generates synthetic samples to balance class distributions.
Feature Selection: Identifies significant features influencing student performance.
Model Optimization: Utilizes ABC and ACO algorithms to fine-tune model parameters.

This repository includes experiments with base models such as Decision Trees (DT), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and XGBoost, both with and without SMOTE. Additionally, Kendall Tau correlation was implemented to assess feature relationships, and Chi-Square tests were presented for optimal feature selection. This framework aims to provide accurate predictions, enabling educational institutions to identify at-risk students and implement timely interventions.
